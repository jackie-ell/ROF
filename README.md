* This application is called Code Drillz. Intended for rigorous training and learning purposes,
  Code Drillz allows students to challenge a series of questions in a drill group set. 
  These questions are related to varying coding topics created by an administrator.
* Upon answering correctly, students will also be shown varying solutions to the question.
* A leaderboard feature was implemented via an point value system (set by the administrator)
that allows the student to see their rank among other students.
